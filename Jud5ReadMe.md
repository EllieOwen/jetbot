Jud5 is a C++ package Including: Machine Vision Library, Statistical Physics Simulator, Apearance Modeling Library and GUI.
The geometric part of the Machine Vision Library is on version 25 and and my best work. It is two collections: a bunch tranformations that do Priciple Component analysis calculations (like converting pixels to undistored pixels, rays, planes carrying through the sigmas) and a collection of fits. The main fits are typical linear (weights from sigmas) and non-linear. The non-linear fits are applications/extention of a non-linear equation solver that I plucked from Tsai. It originally written in Fortran then machine translated to C. I covered it in C++ but it's the only abomination in the library.
