# jetbot
This is a robot that will try to be similar to the NVIDIA Jetbot.  Instead of 3D printing a chassis designed by the NVIDIA Jetbot team we will start with a 2-wheel self balancing robot.  The NVIDIA Jetson Nano will be used and also will have vision.

The brains of the robot will be the NVIDIA Jetson Nano.  It's on backorder and I hope to have it before Memorial Weekend.

Here is some information on the NVIDIA Jetbot:  https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetbot

This is the self-balancing robot we're starting with:  https://www.banggood.com/DIY-Smart-RC-Robot-Car-Self-balancing-Car-APP-Control-Compitable-With-Arduino-p-1427016.html?utm_design=41&utm_source=emarsys&utm_medium=Shipoutinform171129&utm_campaign=trigger-emarsys&utm_content=Winna&sc_src=email_2671705&sc_eh=baaf08149f00f9ea1&sc_llid=12393951&sc_lid=104858042&sc_uid=ALdPQMSVJ1&cur_warehouse=CN
It's being shipped right now and I'll update this post when I receive it and see what's in the kit.  Estimated delivery date is May 24th.

I also have a lot of parts that could be used to make a robot from scratch.  I have motors, motor controllers, Arduinos, Raspberry Pies, 9 DOF IMU, lipo batteries, etc. If anyone want specific information on these parts let me know.

I'll try to work on the Wiki to help document the project.
